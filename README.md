Air Quality Report Dashboard ðŸ“Š
This Power BI project is designed to provide a detailed analysis of air quality across various cities in India. The dashboard presents key pollution metrics, trends, and city-wise insights to help users better understand air quality variations and make data-driven decisions.

Key Highlights:
Summary Metrics:

Average CO Levels: 2.25
Average NO Levels: 17.57
Sum of SOâ‚‚ Levels: 373.14K
Average PM2.5 Levels: 67.45
City-Specific Insights:

Most Polluted Cities: Ahmedabad, Delhi, and Patna rank highest in average AQI, indicating significant pollution levels.
Least Polluted Cities: Coimbatore, Shillong, and Aizawl show the lowest AQI values, reflecting relatively better air quality.
Trends Over Time:
The dashboard includes a line chart that illustrates the AQI trend from 2015 to 2020, showcasing how air quality has evolved over time. This can help identify long-term patterns in pollution levels.

Geospatial Analysis:
A dynamic map displays city-wise average AQI, offering a geographic perspective on pollution hotspots. This visualization enables users to quickly identify areas requiring immediate attention.

Tools and Technologies:
Power BI: For creating the interactive dashboard.
Data Processing: Data was transformed and visualized within Power BI to ensure accuracy and clarity.
Interactivity: Filters and tooltips allow users to explore specific cities and metrics in detail.
Applications:
This project is ideal for policymakers, environmental analysts, and urban planners aiming to tackle air pollution effectively. It can also be used to raise public awareness about air quality in different regions.

How to Use:
Clone the repository and open the Power BI file (.pbix) to explore the dashboard. Customize the data for other regions or timeframes if required.

This project aims to highlight critical pollution metrics and foster better decision-making for improving air quality. Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome! ðŸŒ±
